### Guitar API

I love guitar, so I want to build an API of data about different guitars with a front-end that allows users to browse the different guitars and find one that works for them!

**What problem does your project solve?**

It makes guitars more accessible to people, which is awesome.

**Who has this problem?**

Anybody who doesn't currently own a guitar, as well as anybody who does.

**How will your project solve this problem?**

By allowing someone who is new to playing guitar to browse models at different price ranges and find one that works for them.

**What inputs does it need?**

I'll build forms to determine what the user is looking for (in terms of skill level, price range, etc) and use those to find the best guitars for them.

**What outputs does it produce?**

A list of guitars they should buy!

**What web APIs will it use?**

The one that I build.

**What technologies will it use?**

The front end will be Angular, with a Java backend.

**What additional features will it have?**

That's all I've got so far, although I'm sure I'll think of more.
